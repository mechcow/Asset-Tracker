== About 

This is a ruby on rails asset tracker which is a fork of Preston Lee's asset tracker:

https://github.com/preston/asset_tracker

Features added:

- JQuery AJAX style searching
- Puppet synchronization
- Cobbler synchronization
- CSV Output
- Asset Polymorphism including Virtualized and Physical hosts
- IP Address checking to ensure you don't double-allocate IPs
- LDAP and AuthLogin support

== Dependencies

gems: fastercsv

== Getting Started

1. Create a config/initializers/email.rb with the following...

ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :address => "smtp.gmail.com",
  :port => 587,
  :authentication => :plain,
  :enable_starttls_auto => true,
  :user_name => "noreply@gmail_or_your_google_domain.com",
  :password => "chucknorris"
}

2. Install and configure PostgreSQL and setup a blank database (exact steps will depend upon your OS and environment)

3. Edit config/database.yml and give it the appropriate values to connect to said database

4. rake db:create
5. rake db:fixtures:load
6. rake db:migrate

7. Edit config/ldap.yml and fill in the details about your LDAP server

8. run script/server

You probably now want to first add a Location before you add anything else.
