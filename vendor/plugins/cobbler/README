ruby-cobbler
============

Ruby bindings for interacting with Cobbler.


USAGE
-----

To use the code, you must install the ruby gem named "cobbler" and then
require 'cobbler' in your application. 

Minimally you need to provide a server name for your Cobbler machine using:

Cobbler::Base.hostname = my.cobbler.server

If you intend to modify data on the Cobbler server, you'll need to also provide
a username and password that has authorization:

Cobbler::Base.username = username
Cobbler::Base.password = password

CONFIGURATION
-------------

By default, Cobbler::Base will load the file $SEARCHPATH/config/cobbler.yml, 
if it exists, and use that information for talking to Cobbler. To override 
where this file lives, set the COBBLER_ENV environment variable *before* 
requiring the 'cobbler' file. 

However, these values can be overridden afterward by changing the fields in 
Cobbler::Base directly.
