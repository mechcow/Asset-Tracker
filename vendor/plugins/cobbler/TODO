This is a list of features to be developed in future.

* Attempt to detect when a R/W call fails due to expired auth token and
  retry the previous login.
* Rework the "find_one" method to be "find_by_[field]" instead.
* Add hierarchical relationships, so that a Profile will load it's 
  Distro, a System will load it's Profile, etc.
* Perform an update check before saving or updating a system. [DONE: 21 Aug 2008]
